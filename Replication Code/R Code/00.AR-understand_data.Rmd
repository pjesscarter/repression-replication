# Number of provinces

```{r echo=FALSE}
  uniqueN(d.rep$IDProv)
```

We have 25 provinces (26 with "NA" province). However, in the shapefile division_provincial we have 56.
I guess these are only the one with military presence. Well, no because two provinces does not have military presence.

# Mean and median number of counties in provinces
```{r echo=FALSE}
    mean(n_county$n) 
    median(n_county$n) 
```

# Key info on the relation between province and county
```{r echo=FALSE}
  knitr::kable(inf_county, col.names = c("IDProv", "N county", "N military", "N sample"), caption = "Key info province and county") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

All but two province has a county with military presence.
However, some counties in provinces with military presence are not in the main estimation sample.
  
# Zoom in into relation between province and county 

```{r echo=FALSE}
  knitr::kable(inf_c_victims, col.names = c("IDProv", "Military", "Sample", "N county ", "Avg. Victims", "Avg. Reg", "Avg. NO 1988 pop", "Avg. NO 1970 pop"), caption = "Detail info key var province and county") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

There are counties inside provinces with military presence which are not included.
This seems to be  counties without military presence and high vitimin share in 70.
As I understand the variable "shVictims_70" is the one used as an instrument in the IV.
Need to understand this better.
