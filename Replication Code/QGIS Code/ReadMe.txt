Replication Figure 1 exercise

Notes on stuff that stands out:
	- Comunas (counties) and provinces do not overlap perfectly
	- Specially in the South of the country, provinces go a little crazy. With pockets of provinces inside bigger provinces.
	- Some military bases seem to be on the boundaries of provinces
	- For some counties with military bases we have only one control county in the province
	- There are some counties, next to counties with military presence, that do not have data of repression.
